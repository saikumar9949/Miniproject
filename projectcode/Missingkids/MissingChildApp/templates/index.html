                Abstract-In India a countless number of children are reported missing every year. Among the missing child cases a large percentage of children remain untraced. This paper presents a novel use of deep learning methodology for identifying the reported missing
                child from the photos of multitude of children available, with the help of face recognition. The public can upload photographs of suspicious child into a common portal with landmarks and remarks. The photo will be automatically compared
                with the registered photos of the missing child from the repository.</p>
        <p align="justify">
            <font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color='black'> Classification of the input child image is performed and photo with best match will be selected from the database of missing children. For this, a deep learning model is trained to correctly identify the missing child from the missing child
                image database provided, using the facial image uploaded by the public. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a highly effective deep learning technique for image based applications is adopted here for face recognition.</p>
        <p align="justify">
            <font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color='black'> Face descriptors are extracted from the images using a pre-trained CNN model VGG-Face deep architecture. Compared with normal deep learning applications, our algorithm uses convolution network only as a high level feature extractor and the
                child recognition is done by the trained SVM classifier.
